**How can I develop this idea?**

**How can I break this API?**

**What more can I add?** 

**How can I secure this better?**

```These are some of the questions that I have begun asking myself more frequently ever since I started pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I have always loved a good challenge and using my creativeness to solve a problem in a unique way. While pursuing my degree, not only have I showcased my development strengths, but I have also demonstrated how quickly I can turn a weakness into a strength. Desiring a career in the Computer Science field usually means you will hold a position that requires you to know how to develop error-free code and perhaps use multiple different languages. I have since put into practice the belief that anyone can quickly learn a new programing language, because the only differentiating factor is usually the code syntax; The underlying algorithms, concepts of variables, data structures, and functions is still the same. Therefore, I suggest people should develop a better understanding on the Foundations of Computer Science before writing code. Having a good understanding of the foundations of Computer Science can transform anyone into a collaborative team member, who can communicate to stakeholders, assist in the implementation of data structures and algorithms, and assist in the design of software and databases. Throughout my program, I have not only gained a strong knowledge in the foundations of Computer Science, but I have implemented and developed applications that demonstrate my ability to think long term since I always ensure the code I write is well commented, reusable, and understandable incase someone else decides to expand on it. 
For my capstone project, I was tasked with showcasing my skills and abilities in three key categories: Software design and engineering, Algorithms and data structure, and Databases. I decided to develop a project that showed the iteration and progression from each key category based on the final project from a previous class, CS-340 Advanced Programing. This final project was a RESTful API written in Python that provided an interface to a MongoDB containing detailed information on various stocks. Firstly, I decided to refactor the code from Python to Node.js to expand its usability. Second, after the code was refactored, I iterated the API by adding an authorization and authentication feature to ensure only approved users could utilize the API and thus increased the security of it. Lastly, I decided to expand on the API capabilities by adding more API methods and endpoints.
